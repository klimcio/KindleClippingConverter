Do you have a load of Kindle clippings in their native format?

Don't know what to do with them?

But you know they will come in handy!

Convert them into Markdown files and store them in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

# About the project

The goal of this project is to create a library to parse kindle clippings into useful format.
Hidden goal of this project is to practice functional programming ;-)

# Short project history

At first, I wanted to fill a database.

Then I wanted to convert it into into a JSON file for some sort of Kindle Management App I'll build some day. 

But then I started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) which led me to the current iteration of the idea, which is creating one markdown file per highlight.

# How to run it?

There is a dedicated unit test for it.
Just edit out the directory names ;-)

A new way of running it will be implemented soon. I just have to figure it out how to do it ;-)
