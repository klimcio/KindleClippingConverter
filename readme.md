The goal of this project is to create a library to parse kindle clippings into useful format.
At first, I wanted to fill some database, then I wanted to make it more convertable and maybe turn them into JSON file for some sort of Kindle Management App I'll build some day. But then I started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) which led me to the current iteration of the idea, which is creating one markdown file per highlight.

Hidden goal of this project is to practice functional programming ;-)
